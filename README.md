# HockeynxT
A set of functions to analyze net expected threat using scouting hockey data

**Updates**
- Expected threat is vailable: HockeynxT/xTHockey.py
    - Expected Threat model with variable time-remaining-in-period
    - This version is not the Next Expected threat
    - An example on how to use this module can be found here: examples/Getting xT values.ipynb
- Our **Net expected Threat model** (which uses Opposing Expected Threat) will be available early next week
